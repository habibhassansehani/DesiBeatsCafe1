The POS must include 800+ products, table management, editable orders, tax system, payment methods, order queue, and thermal receipt printing. Everything must be editable in the admin panel. The entire backend must use Vercel serverless API routes instead of Express server hosting. Database must be MongoDB Atlas. The frontend must be built in React or Next.js (preferred for Vercel). The whole system must run on Vercel without needing any external servers.”
